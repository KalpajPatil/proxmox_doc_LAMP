## 📖 Project Overview  
This project presents the **implementation of a highly available LAMP-based web service** hosted on **Proxmox VE 8.4.1**.  
The system ensures **load balancing, high availability, and strong security controls** through fine-grained user, role, and network management.  

This implementation is part of my **Master’s program coursework** and is documented in the style of an **IEEE technical paper**.
